# Infected Docker

## Requirements

 * Docker
 * Docker-compose
 * Git

## Install documentation

 * Things happening before docker is initialized happens in `prepare`
 * Things happening during docker image building is located in `image-assets/installScript`
 * Things happening on each boot is located in `image-assets/boot`
 * Things happening only on first startup is located in `image-assets/run-once`

## Preparing

Run `./prepare` in your favourite bash/sh interpreter. It will clone all required repositories, and place them in the parent folder.

Add the following entries in your `/etc/hosts` file, or other if you have a shitty OS:

```
127.0.0.1	infected.dev
127.0.0.1	crew.infected.dev
127.0.0.1	tickets.infected.dev
127.0.0.1	compo.infected.dev
127.0.0.1	info.infected.dev

```

In order to use https, which is required by the webpage at the moment, you should follow something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7580508/getting-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-localhost-certificate) in order to get the certificate trusted. You can also write `thisisunsafe` in the browser window, but please note that it is not reccomended by people on the internet.

## Running

`docker-compose up`, or `docker-compose up --build` to force a new build at the same time

## Wishes for the future

 * Decouple the websites, to their own seperate containers
   - Maybe make a container for the database which automatically loads the `infected_no` database, which is common for all sites
 * https proxy frontend
